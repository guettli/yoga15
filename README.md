# Ubuntu 20.04 on Lenovo Yoga15 Thinkpad

Since August 2020 I have a Yoga15 Thinkpad running Ubuntu 20.04.

95% of all things I want from a laptop are fine. But there are some
things which could get improved.


I attached a USB3 ethernet adapter. If it is connected, I don't need Wifi.
But nevertheless I get the notification again and again that Wifi can't connect.
That's a bit annoying, since I need to  switch off the Wifi to avoid these
notifications. If I carry the laptop to an other room where I want to use
Wifi, I need to switch it on again.
This was solved by this answer: [Disable WiFi if LAN is connected](https://askubuntu.com/a/1272865/42348)


It change brightness automatically when lighting changes. But it reacts too fast, too often, too hard.
